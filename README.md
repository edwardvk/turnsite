Display Several Websites Fullscreen
Written for Ubuntu 13.04

This script will display any website fullscreen for 20 seconds and then changes to the next one. 
For use as a display screen in foyers. 

In order to use this you will need to install:
apt-get install python-webkit unclutter

Then unpack the files to some folder, I usually just through them in the main users home folder, since it's probably going to be on a dedicated pc anyway.

Then copy the turnstyle.autostart to ~/.config/autostart


Don't forget to set Ubuntu to:
* Automatically log your user in
* Disable the screen saver
